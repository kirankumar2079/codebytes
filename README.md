This repository contains fun , interesting , intutive scripts / programs which are small using which you can learn a lot


## A* Search aLgorithm

A* (a-star) search algorithm is a path finding algorithm using which you can find shortest path between two points in this folder you will find the code for visual a* alogrithm and intructions in the README.md in that folder.

## BFS Search algorithm

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching graph/tree data structures. It explores all the nodes at the current depth level before moving on to nodes at the next level, ensuring the shortest path is found in an unweighted graph. BFS uses a queue to keep track of nodes to visit. [click here to see more details](https://github.com/kirankumar2079/codebytes/tree/main/bfs_search_algo)
